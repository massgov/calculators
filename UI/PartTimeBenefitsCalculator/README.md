# UI: Unemployment Insurance Benefits Calculator for Part-time Workers

Welcome to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Single Page Application (SPA), powering the "Unemployment Insurance Benefits Calculator for Part-time Workers" . This is a static website built with React, [Mayflower React](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/) (Commonwealth's Design System), and our [Mayflower React Starter](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower-react-starter/). The [Mayflower React Starter](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower-react-starter/) is a customized instance of [Facebook's Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

- $ ``git clone https://github.com/massgov/Mayflower-React-Starter.git``
- $ ``cd Mayflower-React-Starter``
- $ ``npm i``
- $ ``npm start``
- Browse to http://localhost:3000, or the custom port shown in the output of npm start.

## System Requirements

- node.js, currently standardized on version 8.9.4
- npm, currently standardized on version 10.10.0
- To run tests locally, you will need to install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).
