# Unemployment Benefits calculator documentation
Use this documentation to learn where the formulas live and how the calculator formula was created.
## Calculator Logic
The main logic of the calculator live in these files:
- [Input](../src/components/Form/index.js)
- [Output](../src/components/Form/output.js)
- [Variables](../src/data/variables.json)

### Variable constants
There are 4 variables that are constants. Here are their values:

`maxBenefitDuration` = 26
`quartersSumThreshhold` = 4700
`weeklyBenefitMax` = 795
`maxBenefitRatio` = 0.36

To change max benefit duration from 26 weeks to 30 weeks, change `maxBenefitDuration` in [Variables](../src/data/variables.json) to `30`.
> This variable will impact the formula of calculating the maxBenefit total and hence the benefits duration outcome.

## Input

Input consists of 4 currency input for total quarterly wages, 1 checkbox for apply first quarter wages to all and a submit button.

### Currency input:
The labels for the 4 currency input are calculated based date ranges based on the current date.
Quarter date range calculation logic:
```
const quarterCurrent = moment().quarter();
const quarterDateRange = (quartersAgo) => {
  const quarter = quarterCurrent - quartersAgo;
  let qEnd = moment().quarter(quarter).endOf('quarter');
  let qStart = moment().quarter(quarter).startOf('quarter');
  qEnd = moment(qEnd).format(format);
  qStart = moment(qStart).format(format);
  return{ qEnd, qStart };
};
```

### Checkbox:
The apply-to-all checkbox is added for the convenience of the users inputing the same quarterly income for the last 4 quarters. Checking the box will keep the other 3 currency inputs in sync with the value in the first currency input; unchecking the box will break out of the sync and let the user edit the value in each of the other 3 currency inputs.

### Submit Button:
The submit button will take the values from the user input and render the new output below.

## Output

### Eligibility
1. Qualification 1: total wages is no less than the threshhold $4700 (`quartersSumThreshhold` in [Variables](../src/data/variables.json))
```
  const qualification1 = !(quartersSum < quartersSumThreshhold);
```
![sample qualification 1 screenshot](./media/output-disqualification1.png)

2. qualification 2: total wages is no less than 30 times the weeklyBenefitFinal
```
  const qualification2 = !(quartersSum < (30 * weeklyBenefitFinalRaw));
```
Example and edge case handling:
```
Q1: $10,000
Q2: $1,538.59 or anything amount that is less than $1,538
```
![sample qualification 2 screenshot](./media/output-disqualification2-fail.png)

```
Q1: $10,000
Q2: $1,538.60 or anything amount that is less than $1,538
```
![sample qualification 2 screenshot](./media/output-disqualification2-pass.png)

To test an edge case with 2 quarter wages, put in a lower quarter's wage that is less than 2/13 of the higher quarter's wage, see formula:
```
For 2 quarters and Q1 >= Q2
Q1 + Q2 >= 30 * 1/2 * Q1 / 13
Q1 + Q2 >= 15 /13 * Q1
Q2 >= 2/13 * Q1
Q2 >â‰ˆ 0.153846 Q1
```


### Benefits Calculation
#### Weekly benefit amount (WBA):
WBA calculation is broken down in 3 steps:
1. `const weeklyBenefit = round(1 / 2 * topQuartersSum / weeksInTopQuarters, 2);`

> WeeklyBenefit is rounded to 2 decimal places (penny amount)
> WeeklyBenefit is calculated based on the number of quarters that have wages out of the last 4 quarters:
> - If only 2 or less quarters have wages, WBA is equal to half of the highest-earning quarter divided by the number of weeks in the quarter (13).
> - If more than 2 quarters have wages, WBA is equal to half of the sum of total wages for the 2 highest-earning quarters divided by the number of weeks in the combined quarters (26).
```
  let topQuarters;
  let weeksInTopQuarters = 26;
  if (quartersCount > 2) {
    topQuarters = quartersHaveValue.sort((q1, q2) => q2 - q1).slice(0, 2);
  } else if (quartersCount > 0) {
    topQuarters = quartersHaveValue.sort((q1, q2) => q2 - q1).slice(0, 1);
    weeksInTopQuarters = 13;
  }
  const topQuartersSum = topQuarters && topQuarters.length > 0 && topQuarters.reduce(sum);
```
2. `const weeklyBenefitFinalRaw = weeklyBenefit > weeklyBenefitMax ? weeklyBenefitMax : weeklyBenefit;`
> WeeklyBenefitFinalRaw is making sure that the weeklyBenefit never exceeds the maximum
> This is used in calculating the qualification 2 threshold `(30 * weeklyBenefitFinal)` before rounding to dollar amount
3. `const weeklyBenefitFinal = Math.round(weeklyBenefitFinalRaw);`
> WeeklyBenefitFinal is rounded to the nearest dollar amount
> This is used in the calculation of the max benefits credit and the final display of WBA

e.g. Enter `$10,000.00` in all 4 quarters
![30 weeks benefits based on each quarter income $10,000 for 4 quarters](./media/output-30-wba.png)

If weeklyBenefitMax ([\$795](../src/data/variables.json)) is reached, WBA is set to `weeklyBenefitMax`.
e.g. Enter `$25,000.00` in all 4 quarters
![30 weeks benefits exceeding max weekly benefit amount](./media/output-30-max-wba.png)

#### Max benefits credit calculation:
```
const maxBenefitOption1 = maxBenefitDuration * weeklyBenefitFinal;
const maxBenefitOption2 = maxBenefitRatio * quartersSum;
const maxBenefitFinal = maxBenefitOption1 > maxBenefitOption2 ? maxBenefitOption2 : maxBenefitOption1;
const maxBenefitOther = maxBenefitOption1 > maxBenefitOption2 ? maxBenefitOption1 : maxBenefitOption2;
```
e.g. Enter `$10,000.00` in all 4 quarters
![30 weeks max benefits credit calculation](./media/output-30-max.png)
#### Benefits duration calculation:
```
const benefitDuration = maxBenefitFinal / weeklyBenefitFinal;
```
e.g. Enter `$10,000.00` in all 4 quarters
![30 weeks benefits exceeding max weekly benefit amount](./media/output-30-duration.png)
